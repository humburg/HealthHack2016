# Test data based on paired end RNA sequencing reads assembled with PEAR [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/version/humburg/test-rna-assembled.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/humburg/test-rna-assembled/ "Get image from Docker Hub")

This is a small dataset intended for testing. It based on 
[Jurkat RNA-seq data](https://hub.docker.com/r/humburg/jurkat-only-rna-assembled/)
and consists of the first 10,000 reads from that dataset.
