# Jurkat RNA-seq data 
[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/version/humburg/jurkat-only-rna.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/humburg/jurkat-only-rna/ "Get it from Docker Hub")
Paired-end RNA-seq data from Jurkat cell line. Each read starts with an eight
base molecular identifier followed by four constant bases (GACT/AGTC).  

This image contains the raw data. A processed version of the data where
overlapping reads from a pair have been merged is also
[available](https://hub.docker.com/r/humburg/jurkat-only-rna-assembled/).
